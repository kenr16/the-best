    <h1>This is "The Best" band.</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <p>The Best was a short-lived supergroup featuring Keith Emerson (of Emerson, Lake and Palmer) on keyboards, John Entwistle (of The Who) on bass and vocals, Joe Walsh (Eagles, James Gang, and solo fame) on guitar and vocals, Jeff "Skunk" Baxter (Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers) on guitar, and Simon Phillips (the Jack Bruce Band, 801, the Jeff Beck Group; later of Toto) on drums. Relative unknown Rick Livingstone[1] sang lead vocals (along with Walsh and Entwistle). Backing vocals were provided by Hamish, Angus and Fergus Richardson of the band Brother.</p>

      <p>In a 1994 interview posted on The Who mailing list Entwistle said that The Best had toured Japan, and that an American tour had been planned but never came to fruition.[2] In the same interview he also noted that drummer Zak Starkey had also been "in the band a while", presumably before Phillips joined.</p>
